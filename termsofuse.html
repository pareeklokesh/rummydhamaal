                        <p>“Cash Game(s)” are games requiring the participant to have a certain minimum cash balance in their user account to participate. All other Games offered on the Website are defined as Non-Cash Game(s).</p>
                        <p>RummyDhamaal charges service charges for Cash Games, which may vary depending on the nature of the Cash Game and are subject to change from time to time. Non-Cash Games are offered free on the Website but may be subject to entry restrictions in some cases. Service charges charged by RummyDhamaal are inclusive of all applicable taxes, including Goods & Services Tax.</p>

Remember that the Bonus must be earned (disbursed) within the stipulated claim period, which may differ based on the offer.
                </p>
                <p>For example – If you have Rs.100 bonus and you play a deals rummy game of Rs. 200, 10% of Rs.200, i.e., Rs.20 bonus, would be credited to your withdrawal balance once the game is completed. If you play the next game of Rs.500, then 10% of Rs.500, i.e., Rs.50 bonus, would be credited to your withdrawal balance. It will continue till the whole bonus amount is released. The release percentage/rate may vary depending on the offer.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 600;color: yellow;">Please Note: </span>One player can have only one account on RummyDhamaal. If multiple accounts are detected, the entire bonus amount on all accounts will be canceled. The Terms of Service apply to all services offered on RummyDhamaal.

                <p>Our random number generator (RNG) has been verified by iTech Labs, a globally competent authority (ISO 17025 certified) for RNG verification and provides RNG certifications to gaming companies globally. The RNG uses an algorithm to generate random numbers, ensuring that all players get cards selected randomly from a well-shuffled deck and are dealt fairly by the system without any bias. The shuffling tests were conducted on large enough samples to give the calculations sufficient. As a result, iTech Labs has found that the card sequences are unpredictable, non-repeatable, and uniformly distributed.
